# Elasticsearch and Kibana Docker Setup

This project provides a Docker Compose setup for running Elasticsearch and Kibana together. It includes a script to initialize the services and set the Kibana system user password after Elasticsearch is fully up and running.

## Prerequisites

- Docker
- Docker Compose

## Setup and Installation

1. **Clone the repository**:

   ```bash
   git clone <repository-url>
   cd <project-directory>
   ```

2. **Set up your environment variables**:

   Replace `<ES_PASSWORD>` and `<KIB_PASSWORD>` in the script with your desired Elasticsearch and Kibana passwords.

   ```bash
   # Inside start_services.sh
   ES_PASSWORD="<your_elasticsearch_password>"
   KIBANA_PASSWORD="<your_kibana_password>"
   ```

3. **Start the services**:

   Use the provided `start_services.sh` script to start the services and configure the Kibana system user password.

   ```bash
   ./start_services.sh
   ```

   This script will:
   - Start the Elasticsearch and Kibana services using Docker Compose.
   - Wait until Elasticsearch is fully up and running.
   - Set the Kibana system user password.

4. **Access Kibana**:

   Once the services are up and running, you can access Kibana in your web browser at:

   ```
   http://localhost:5601
   ```

## Troubleshooting

- **Elasticsearch not starting**: Ensure your Docker has enough memory allocated (at least 4GB is recommended).
- **Kibana not connecting to Elasticsearch**: Make sure the passwords in the environment variables match and Elasticsearch is fully up before Kibana tries to connect.
